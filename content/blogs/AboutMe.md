Hi, 
I am Ivo, an Austrian Masters student reading for the Masters in Financial Analysis at London Business School. 
Apart from my academic / professional interests I have two true passions: 
1)	Firstly, I have played the jazz piano for nearly 17 years now – this field nearly has become my profession but fortunately (my current opinion – might change in quarter / mid-life crisis) I started studying business 
2)	Not done to a very professional extent but very passionate is trail running – my favourite trail is around Lainzer Tiergarten, being located in the beginning of Austrian Alps in Vienna.
