# Challenge 1: Yield Curve inversion

Every so often, we hear warnings from commentators on the "inverted yield curve" and its predictive power with respect to recessions. An explainer what a [inverted yield curve is can be found here](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-economy-yieldcurve-explainer/explainer-what-is-an-inverted-yield-curve-idUSKBN1O50GA). If you'd rather listen to something, here is a great podcast from [NPR on yield curve indicators](https://www.podbean.com/media/share/dir-4zgj9-6aefd11)

In addition, many articles and commentators think that, e.g., [*Yield curve inversion is viewed as a harbinger of recession*](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-08-14/u-k-yield-curve-inverts-for-first-time-since-financial-crisis). One can always doubt whether inversions are truly a harbinger of recessions, and [use the attached parable on yield curve inversions](https://twitter.com/5_min_macro/status/1161627360946511873).

In our case we will look at US data and use the [FRED database](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/) to download historical yield curve rates, and plot the yield curves since 1999 to see when the yield curves flatten. There's further information from an article that explains the [yield curve is and its inversion can be found here](https://fredblog.stlouisfed.org/2018/10/the-data-behind-the-fear-of-yield-curve-inversions/). 

First, we will load the yield curve data file that contains data on the yield curve since 1960-01-01
```{r download_historical_yield_curve, warning=FALSE}
yield_curve <- read_csv(here::here("data", "yield_curve.csv"))
glimpse(yield_curve)
```

Our dataframe `yield_curve` has five columns (variables):

- `date`: already a date object
- `series_id`: the FRED database ticker symbol
- `value`: the actual yield on that date
- `maturity`: a short hand for the maturity of the bond
- `duration`: the duration, written out in all its glory!

## Plotting the yield curve

We are going to create three plots here.

### Yields on US rates by duration since 1960

We first need to replicate the following sample.
```{r yield_curve_1, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "yield_curve1.png"), error = FALSE)
```

```{r yield_curve_1: Yields on US rates by duration since 1960, out.width="100%",fig.width=15, fig.height=12}
# unique(yield_curve$duration)
yield_curve <- yield_curve %>%
  #factor the duration variable in the correct order
  mutate(duration=factor(duration,levels = c("3-Month Treasury Bill","6-Month Treasury Bill","1-Year Treasury Rate","2-Year Treasury Rate",
                                          "3-Year Treasury Rate","5-Year Treasury Rate","7-Year Treasury Rate","10-Year Treasury Rate",
                                          "20-Year Treasury Rate","30-Year Treasury Rate"))) 

ggplot(yield_curve,aes(x=date,y=value,color=duration))+
  geom_line()+
  #ncol sets the number of columns in the plot
  facet_wrap(~duration,ncol=2)+
  theme_bw()+
  theme(legend.position = "none",
        plot.title =element_text(size=16, face='bold',hjust = 0,margin = margin(10,0,10,0)),
        plot.subtitle =element_text(size=16, hjust = 0), 
        axis.text.x = element_text(size=10),
        axis.text.y = element_text(size=12),
        axis.ticks.x = element_line(),
        axis.ticks.y=element_line(),
        axis.title.x = element_text(size=16,face='bold'),
        axis.title.y = element_text(size=16,face='bold'),
        ) +
  labs(title = "Yields on U.S. Treasury rates since 1960", 
       caption= "Source: St. Louis Federal Reserve Economic Database (FRED)",
       x="",y="%") 
```

### Monthly yields on US rates by duration since 1999 on a year-by-year basis

We then try to replicate the following graph.
```{r yield_curve_2, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "yield_curve2.png"), error = FALSE)
```

```{r yield_curve_2: Monthly yields on US rates by duration since 1999 on a year-by-year basis,out.width="100%",fig.width=15, fig.height=12}
yield_curve <- yield_curve %>%
  mutate(year=year(date),
         month=month(date),
         # for maturity, we also factor this variable in the correct order
         maturity=factor(maturity,levels = c("3m","6m","1y","2y",
                                          "3y","5y","7y","10y",
                                          "20y","30y")))
  

yield_curve %>%
  filter(year>=1999) %>%
  ggplot()+
  geom_line(aes(x=maturity,y=value,group=month,color=factor(year)))+
  facet_wrap(~year,ncol=4)+
  theme_bw()+
  theme(legend.position = "none",
        plot.title =element_text(size=16, face='bold',hjust = 0,margin = margin(10,0,10,0)),
        plot.subtitle =element_text(size=16, hjust = 0), 
        axis.text.x = element_text(size=10),
        axis.text.y = element_text(size=12),
        axis.ticks.x = element_line(),
        axis.ticks.y=element_line(),
        axis.title.x = element_text(size=16,face='bold'),
        axis.title.y = element_text(size=16,face='bold'),
        ) +
  labs(title = "US Yield Curve: monthly yields by duration on a year-by-year basis", 
       caption= "Source: St. Louis Federal Reserve Economic Database (FRED)",
       x="Maturity",y="Yield(%)") 

```


### 3-month and 10-year yields since 1999

We then replicate the following plot for 3-month and 10-year yields.
```{r yield_curve_3, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "yield_curve3.png"), error = FALSE)
```

```{r yield_curve_3: 3-month and 10-year yields since 1999,out.width="100%",fig.width=15, fig.height=12}
yield_curve %>%
  # filter out the year starting from 1999, and 3-month and 10-year yields
  filter(year>=1999)%>%
  filter(maturity=="3m"|maturity=="10y") %>%
  ggplot()+
  geom_line(aes(x=date,y=value,group=maturity,color=duration))+
  # we are trying to color different yields
  scale_colour_manual(breaks=c("3-Month Treasury Bill","10-Year Treasury Rate"),values=c("#CB454A","#3498DB"))+
  theme_bw()+
  theme(legend.position = "right",
        legend.title = element_blank(),
        plot.title =element_text(size=16, face='bold',hjust = 0,margin = margin(10,0,10,0)),
        plot.subtitle =element_text(size=16, hjust = 0), #put titles in the middle
        axis.text.x = element_text(size=10),
        axis.text.y = element_text(size=12),
        axis.ticks.x = element_line(),
        axis.ticks.y=element_line(),
        axis.title.x = element_text(size=16,face='bold'),
        axis.title.y = element_text(size=16,face='bold'),
        ) +
  labs(title = "Yields on 3-month and 10-year US Treasury rates since 1999", 
       caption= "Source: St. Louis Federal Reserve Economic Database (FRED)",
       x="",y="%") 

```

According to [Wikipedia's list of recession in the United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_recessions_in_the_United_States), since 1999 there have been two recession in the US: between Mar 2001–Nov 2001 and between Dec 2007–June 2009. 
The yield curve seems to flatten before these recessions. Usually the flattening yield curve is an economic indicator of recessions. 
Since 1999, short-term (3 months) yield has been higher than the long term (10 years) debt for three time: Early 2001(2001 Recession), late 2006 to 2007(housing bubble crisis, subprime lending crisis) and late 2019(covid pandemic). 


### spread (10year - 3months)

To create our final plot, we do the following steps:
1. Calculate the spread (10year - 3months)
2. Plot the spread between 10 years and 3 months as a blue/red ribbon, blue for positive and red for negative
3. Superimpose recessions as the grey areas in our plot
4. Plot the rugs on x-axis

The sample is as follows:
```{r yield_curve_challenge, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "yield_curve_challenge.png"), error = FALSE)
```

We get the recession data first.
```{r setup_US-recessions, warning=FALSE}

# get US recession dates after 1946 from Wikipedia 
# https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_recessions_in_the_United_States

recessions <- tibble(
  from = c("1948-11-01", "1953-07-01", "1957-08-01", "1960-04-01", "1969-12-01", "1973-11-01", "1980-01-01","1981-07-01", "1990-07-01", "2001-03-01", "2007-12-01","2020-02-01"),  
  to = c("1949-10-01", "1954-05-01", "1958-04-01", "1961-02-01", "1970-11-01", "1975-03-01", "1980-07-01", "1982-11-01", "1991-03-01", "2001-11-01", "2009-06-01", "2020-04-30") 
  )  %>% 
  mutate(From = ymd(from), 
         To=ymd(to),
         duration_days = To-From)

recessions
```

We manipulate the data to calculate the up-and-down spreads.
```{r create spread, up and down, warning=FALSE}
yield_curve_recession <- yield_curve %>%
  filter(maturity=="3m"|maturity=="10y") %>%
  group_by(date)%>%
  pivot_wider(id_col=1, names_from = duration, values_from=value) %>%
  clean_names() %>%
  mutate(spread = x10_year_treasury_rate - x3_month_treasury_bill,
         up = ifelse(spread>0, spread, 0), #up gives the diffrence between 10y and 3m when 10y>3m
         down = ifelse(spread<0, spread, 0)) #down gives the diffrence between 10y and 3m when 10y<3m

```

```{r plot the spread (10year - 3months), out.width="100%",fig.width=15, fig.height=9}
yield_curve_recession %>%
  ggplot()+
  #plot rectangles for recessions
  geom_rect(data=recessions %>% filter(From>="1960-01-01"),
            aes(xmin=From,xmax=To,ymin=-Inf,ymax=Inf),colour="grey",alpha=0.2)+ 
  scale_x_date(date_breaks = "2 years", date_labels = "%Y")+
  #plot rug for x asis
  geom_rug(aes(x=date,colour=ifelse(x10_year_treasury_rate>=x3_month_treasury_bill,">=0","<0")),sides="b")+ 
  scale_colour_manual(values=c("#EC7063","#2874A6"),name="Actual vs Expected ", guide=FALSE)+
  geom_line(aes(x=date,y=spread,fill="black"))+
  #plot the areas in blue using up when 10y>3m
  geom_ribbon(aes(x=date,ymin=0,
                  ymax=up),alpha=0.4,fill="#2874A6")+ 
  #plot the areas in red using down when 10y<3m
  geom_ribbon(aes(x=date,ymin=down,
                  ymax=0),alpha=0.4,fill="#EC7063")+ 
  theme_bw()  +
  theme(legend.position = "none",
        plot.title =element_text(size=16, face='bold',hjust = 0,margin = margin(10,0,10,0)),
        plot.subtitle =element_text(size=16, hjust = 0), 
        axis.text.x = element_text(size=10),
        axis.text.y = element_text(size=12),
        axis.ticks.x = element_line(),
        axis.ticks.y=element_line(),
        axis.title.x = element_text(size=16,face='bold'),
        axis.title.y = element_text(size=16,face='bold'),
        ) +
  labs(title = "Yield Curve Inversion: 10-year minus 3-month U.S. Treasury rates", 
       subtitle = "Difference in % points, monthly averages,
