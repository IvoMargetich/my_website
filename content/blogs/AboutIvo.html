<p>Hi,
I am Ivo, an Austrian Masters student reading for the Masters in Financial
Analysis at London Business School.
Apart from my academic / professional interests I have two true passions:
1) Firstly, I have played the jazz piano for nearly 17 years now – this field
nearly has become my profession but fortunately
(my current opinion – might change in quarter / mid-life crisis)
I started studying business
2) Not done to a very professional extent but very passionate is trail running
– my favourite trail is around Lainzer Tiergarten, being located in the
beginning of Austrian Alps in Vienna. A picture from this trail round is on the
top of this site.</p>
